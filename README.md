Description:
I have have been asked to create a password generator to help the client create secure passwords that will protect the company's interests. The password generator has specific secure password criteria like character limits, uppercase or lowercase sensitivity, numeric requirements, and special characters. Once acceptance criteria for the password is met there will be an alert displayed on the page.
